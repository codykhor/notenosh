# NoteNosh

NoteNosh is an application that combines music and cuisine. The application enables music enthusiast to discover music events throughout Australia by searching for locations or artistâ€™s names and explore dining options in the vicinity of the event venue. Furthermore, it features music events that are happening on the current day and allows users to dive deeper by providing related videos of the event for an immersive experience. Data is generated from multiple APIs.

NoteNosh uses one of the cloud persistence services, Amazon S3, to track a site visit counter. The counter can be found at the footer of the home page. The application is deployed via a Docker container.

The application is a university project that uses cloud services provided by the university therefore the services may no longer be available due to unit completion and revoked access.
